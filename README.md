#Just Another Mandelbrot Fractal
Probably the number of implementations of Mandelbrot fractals in different languages ​​has long exceeded several million.
But who cares? ;)  
A fractal is a beautiful thing, and beauty seems to be supposed to save the world, therefore many fractals are for the better.  
On other side , Rust is an  beautiful language, but it’s boring to learn just like that, so here is my contribution to saving the world, yes!  
Thanks to the creators of [Nannow](https://nannou.cc/) and special thanks to Benoit Mandelbrot, who came up with this beauty.
